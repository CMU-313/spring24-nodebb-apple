User Guide

Resolve topic:

A user is able to resolve a topic if they are the owner of that topic, a forum administrator, or a forum moderator. 

All users, including guests, can see whether a topic has been resolved.

If you have the necessary permissions, you will see the 'resolve' button for all available resolveable posts next to the 'reply' button. 

Clicking the resolve button resolves a topic. This is a irreversible action. 

After a topic is resolved, you will see its resolution status being updated next to the title. The page automatically reloads once a topic is resolved in order to show the updated resolution status. 

Testing:

Automated tests were added for resolve topic feature, located from lines 700 - 717. They test that a topic can be resolved by a user with appropriate privileges, and that a topic cannot be resolved by a user with inappropriate privileges.
